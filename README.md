# OpenCV-Color-Identification-Project
<br><br>
- In this project, I used OpenCv in Visual Studio code  to create a project that works through the camera by specifying the color of the object that is placed in front of the camera, provided that the object is placed on the point that is in the center of the camera square when the project runs.

- These are some experiences on the project :
